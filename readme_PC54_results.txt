Folder contains results wrt:

-only peak pwr charges (no capex, no other opex)
-all have perfect efficiencies BUT electrolyzer
-cost fct for grid use fixed to BD>3500h

Q: how can LCOE almost double (ie peak power drawn from grid, when there is so little change in efficiency in electrolyzer?
    - initial charge to tank is given in an adequate manner and low loading periods would allow to operate trafo much more like in the ideal case.
